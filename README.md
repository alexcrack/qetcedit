# qEtcEdit hosts file GUI Editor

qEtcEdit is a simple util for edit hosts-file in a comfortable way

It supports templates with list of several hosts. This template might be enabled or disabled by checkboxes.

Util is inspired by [host-switcher](https://code.google.com/archive/p/host-switcher/) that hasn't supported since 2011. Thanks to author.
